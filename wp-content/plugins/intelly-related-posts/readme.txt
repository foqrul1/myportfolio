Inline Related Posts AUTOMATICALLY inserts related posts INSIDE your content, capturing immediately the reader's attention. 

== Description ==

Companies like Entrepreneur, The Wall Street Journal, BBC, Business Insider, Financial Times and many others understood this concept and embraced it as you can see in this GIF in <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/intelly-related-posts/screenshots/">Screenshots</a>.

In <a href="http://www.intellywp.com" target="_blank">IntellyWP</a> we take care of the marketing aspects of your Wordpress site and today we have brought to you the same technology they use, to help you to increase engagement, page views and to reduce the bounce rate.

> <strong>Just one week after testing this plugin on a low traffic site, our page views increased by 99%.</strong>

<strong>ANOTHER IMPORTANT POINT OF VIEW</strong>
<br>
How many things have you have in the footer post?

* The author box?
* Subscription to your newsletter?
* Maybe you ask users to share the post on social networks?
* You ask them to leave a comment?
* And also... to read related posts?

Do you know that asking too many things is equal to ask nothing?
